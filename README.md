This project is an interactive dashboard built with Next.js and TypeScript. It allows users to visualize time-series data from the Open-Meteo API on an interactive map. Users can draw polygonal regions, which are then dynamically colored based on user-defined rules and data fetched for a specific time selected via a timeline slider.
